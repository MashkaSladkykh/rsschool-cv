### About
***

Since September 2021 – I started studying at IT school Hillel on course Front-end Basic. 
In this course, I gained a lot of experience in creating HTML layouts. Than I decided to 
improve my knowledge of front-end and started a new course in the same school - Front-end Pro.

Now I have a lot of knowledges which I'd like to use in real project.
